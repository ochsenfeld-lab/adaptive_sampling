 * *Statistically optimal analysis of the extended-system adaptive biasing force (eABF) method* 
    - Authors: Andreas Hulm, Johannes C. B. Dietschreit, Christian Ochsenfeld
    - Journal: J. Chem. Phys. **2022**, 157, 024110
    - DOI: `10.1063/5.0095554 <https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0095554>`_
    - **Abstract**: We present a new method for the statistically optimal analysis of the eABF method based on the MBAR estimator, which allows for accurate estimation of free energy profiles and reaction rates as well as other ensemble properties. The method is implemented in the `adaptive_sampling` package and is demonstrated on several test systems.
